# NYC Housing Analysis

Data used from Kaggle: NYC_ Housing1.CSV


In this project, we highlighted the diversity of NYC's population. We explored the crime rates in different boroughs and how rent correlates to income across NYC's neighborhoods. Our findings provide valuable insights into the diverse communities in New York City.

The "Report" file contains a full analysis of NYC Housing data, and the jupyter notebook file contains the python script used for teh analysis and visualizations.
